	abstract = {{RAVEN} is a software framework able to perform parametric and stochastic analysis based on the response of complex system codes. The initial development was aimed at providing dynamic risk analysis capabilities to the thermohydraulic code {RELAP}-7, currently under development at Idaho National Laboratory ({INL}). Although the initial goal has been fully accomplished, {RAVEN} is now a multi-purpose stochastic and uncertainty quantification platform, capable of communicating with any system code. In fact, the provided Application Programming Interfaces ({APIs}) allow {RAVEN} to interact with any code as long as all the parameters that need to be perturbed are accessible by input files or via python interfaces. {RAVEN} is capable of investigating system response and explore input space using various sampling schemes such as Monte Carlo, grid, or Latin hypercube. However, {RAVEN} strength lies in its system feature discovery capabilities such as: constructing limit surfaces, separating regions of the input space leading to system failure, and using dynamic supervised learning techniques. The development of {RAVEN} started in 2012 when, within the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation ({NEAMS}) program, the need to provide a modern risk evaluation framework arose. {RAVEN}â€™s principal assignment is to provide the necessary software and algorithms in order to employ the concepts developed by the Risk Informed Safety Margin Characterization ({RISMC}) program. {RISMC} is one of the pathways defined within the Light Water Reactor Sustainability ({LWRS}) program. In the {RISMC} approach, the goal is not just to identify the frequency of an event potentially leading to a system failure, but the proximity (or lack thereof) to key safety-related events. Hence, the approach is interested in identifying and increasing the safety margins related to those events. A safety margin is a numerical value quantifying the probability that a safety metric (e.g. peak pressure in a pipe) is exceeded under certain conditions. Most of the capabilities, implemented having {RELAP}-7 as a principal focus, are easily deployable to other system codes. For this reason, several side activates have been employed (e.g. {RELAP}5-3D, any {MOOSE}-based App, etc.) or are currently ongoing for coupling {RAVEN} with several different software. The aim of this document is to provide a set of commented examples that can help the user to become familiar with the {RAVEN} code usage.},

	abstract = {{RAVEN} is a generic software framework to perform parametric and probabilistic analysis based on the response of complex system codes. The initial development was aimed to provide dynamic risk analysis capabilities to the Thermo-Hydraulic code {RELAP}-7, currently under development at the Idaho National Laboratory ({INL}). Although the initial goal has been fully accomplished, {RAVEN} is now a multi-purpose probabilistic and uncertainty quantification platform, capable to agnostically communicate with any system code. This agnosticism includes providing Application Programming Interfaces ({APIs}). These {APIs} are used to allow {RAVEN} to interact with any code as long as all the parameters that need to be perturbed are accessible by inputs files or via python interfaces. {RAVEN} is capable of investigating the system response, and investigating the input space using Monte Carlo, Grid, or Latin Hyper Cube sampling schemes, but its strength is focused to- ward system feature discovery, such as limit surfaces, separating regions of the input space leading to system failure, using dynamic supervised learning techniques. The development of {RAVEN} has started in 2012, when, within the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation ({NEAMS}) program, the need to provide a modern risk evaluation framework became stronger. {RAVEN} principal assignment is to provide the necessary software and algorithms in order to employ the concept developed by the Risk Informed Safety Margin Characterization ({RISMC}) program. {RISMC} is one of the pathways defined within the Light Water Reactor Sustainability ({LWRS}) program. In the {RISMC} approach, the goal is not just the individuation of the frequency of an event potentially leading to a system failure, but the closeness (or not) to key safety-related events. Hence, the approach is interested in identifying and increasing the safety margins related to those events. A safety margin is a numerical value quantifying the probability that a safety metric (e.g. for an important process such as peak pressure in a pipe) is exceeded under certain conditions. The initial development of {RAVEN} has been focused on providing dynamic risk assessment capability to {RELAP}-7, currently under development at the {INL} and, likely, future replacement of the {RELAP}5-3D code. Most the capabilities that have been implemented having {RELAP}-7 as principal focus are easily deployable for other system codes. For this reason, several side activates are currently ongoing for coupling {RAVEN} with soft- ware such as {RELAP}5-3D, etc. The aim of this document is the explanation of the input requirements, focalizing on the input structure.},
